This project is relying on building a client-server app in Java and C# programming languages. 

Context: There is a travel agency which offer flight tickets to different customers. Implemens the functionality on buying flight tickets on specific date and on specific location.

The client side is implemented in Java and C#. Multiple customers can log in to the system and to make requests to the servers.
The server side is implemented in Java and C#. The serve side serves the request and send responses to them.

I used a lot of technologies: Spring, RPC, ORM, Hibernate, REST Services, ActiveMq, Gradle, Protocol Buffers, GRPC, Networking in Java/C#.
